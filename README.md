## Usage
1. Map the driver once (preferably with [kdmapper](https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper))
2. Input the drivers you want to dump in C:\driver_dumper\config.hxfd like this:
```
win32k.sys
win32kfull.sys
win32kbase.sys
ntoskrnl.exe
```
3. Map the driver again, your dumps will be in C:\driver_dumper
